## Summary
These results show that there is only an 8 degree difference in mean temperature between June and December. Additionally, while the minimum temperatures show an 8 degree difference, the maximum temperatures only show a 2 degree difference. This shows that while some days the temperature does dip lower in December, there is still potential for days to be nearly as warm in December as they are in June. This potential for year-round warm days demonstrates that Oahu would be a great place to open an ice cream shop.

To gain more information, you could run an additional query to show the precipitation statistics for June and December. Knowing the precipitation levels could benefit potential investors in the ice cream shop because there may be a correlation between precipitation and ice cream sales.
